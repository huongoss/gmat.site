          An intentional daily routine is the single highest‑leverage system you can build for GMAT improvement. Talent and bursts
          of motivation help, but consistency compounds. This guide gives you a pragmatic, data‑driven framework to design (and stick to)
          a routine that survives busy weeks, plateaus, and test anxiety.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Anchor Around Your Goal Score Backwards</h2>
        <p>
          Start with your target (e.g. 705) and an honest baseline (e.g. 630). The delta defines the intensity needed. A 70–90 point
          lift typically requires 80–120 focused practice hours for most candidates. Divide required hours by weeks until test date →
          that becomes your <strong>weekly volume budget</strong>. Protect it on your calendar first—before meetings, before errands.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Define Daily Minimums and Weekly Flex</h2>
        <p>
          Rigid, identical daily quotas break the first time life intervenes. Instead set:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Daily floor</strong>: the smallest unit that keeps momentum alive (e.g. 8–10 high‑quality questions + 10 min review).</li>
          <li><strong>Weekly target</strong>: e.g. 6 focused sessions (4 core + 2 lighter recovery sessions).</li>
          <li><strong>Recovery buffer</strong>: 1 day with only light error log review or none at all—prevents burnout.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Structure Each Micro Session (45–65 min)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>5 min: Warm start – scan yesterday’s mistakes (reactivate patterns).</li>
          <li>25–35 min: Focus block – timed mixed set (Quant + Verbal), OR single weak area if early phase.</li>
          <li>10–15 min: Deep review – WHY was each wrong/slow? Classify error: Concept, Process, Timing, Careless, Guess.</li>
          <li>5–10 min: Update error log + flash / pattern cards.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Logging root cause is what converts raw question volume into skill gains. Never skip the review step—skipped review is
          wasted practice.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Use Spaced Difficulty Cycling</h2>
        <p>
          Early weeks: bias toward medium difficulty to stabilize process. Middle phase: introduce controlled harder items (20–30%).
          Final polishing: reintroduce earlier mistakes for spaced retrieval. Avoid chasing only hardest problems—it inflates
          cognitive load and masks timing discipline.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Instrument Your Progress (Lightweight Metrics)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accuracy trend</strong> (rolling 7‑day % by category)</li>
          <li><strong>Average time per question</strong> vs target (e.g. DS ≤ 2:10, SC ≤ 1:20)</li>
          <li><strong>Error type distribution</strong> (Concept vs Process vs Careless)</li>
          <li><strong>Retention checks</strong>: resurfacing an error after 3, 7, 14 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A plateau usually means one of two things: (1) Review quality drifted down; (2) You’re not re‑exposing prior errors (no spaced retrieval).
        </p>
        <h2>6. Protect Cognitive Freshness</h2>
        <p>
          GMAT fatigue is real. Hard sets after energy collapse teach bad pacing heuristics. Schedule core sets in your personal “peak window”
          (often 90–120 minutes after waking). Use lighter reading / error log review in lower‑energy parts of the day.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Weekly Retrospective (15 min)</h2>
        <p>
          End of week: skim error log, tag any repeating concepts, pick 2–3 micro‑objectives for next week (e.g. “Reduce careless SC errors”,
          “Solidify Weighted Average setups”). Remove objectives once stable—this forces focus.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Simulate Official Conditions Early (But Not Daily)</h2>
        <p>
          Every 2–3 weeks run a full length simulation (with breaks). Capture pacing drift points (e.g. slump after Q17). Then
          design one mid‑week mini‑set targeting that energy dip (deliberate practice loop).
        </p>
        <h2>9. Build a Frictionless Start Trigger</h2>
        <p>
          Reduce startup friction: keep a “Today Set” button (like this app’s Daily) and pre‑decide your first block the night before.
          Momentum loss usually happens in the first 5 minutes of indecision, not mid‑set.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Track Leading Indicators, Not Just Practice Count</h2>
        <p>
          Raw question count can lag true improvement. Emphasize: decreasing repeat error rate, stabilized pacing, faster recognition
          of trap patterns. Celebrate those—they precede score jumps.
        </p>
        <h2>Template: Your First Week Plan</h2>
        <pre style={{background:'#111',color:'#fff',padding:'1rem',overflowX:'auto',borderRadius:6,fontSize:'0.85rem'}}>{`Day 1  Mixed 12Q (Quant focus) + review 15m\nDay 2  Mixed 10Q (Verbal focus) + review 15m\nDay 3  Timing drill: 8 DS + 8 PS (split) + review\nDay 4  Mixed 12Q (balanced) + error log consolidate\nDay 5  Light: 6 SC + 6 CR + 10m flash / patterns\nDay 6  Medium set 15Q + deeper concept refresh\nDay 7  OFF or 15m passive review (error log skim)`}</pre>
        <p>
          Iterate weekly—avoid radical overhauls. Slightly adjust volume or focus categories, but keep the ritual skeleton stable.
        </p>
        <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Endless question grinding without categorizing mistakes</li>
          <li>Delaying full simulations until the final month</li>
          <li>Practicing only strongest section (comfort repetition)</li>
          <li>Ignoring timing review on correct but slow answers</li>
          <li>Overusing very hard problems early → morale decay</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Final Thought</h2>
        <p>
          Elite scorers are rarely those who “worked the hardest” in chaotic bursts—they engineered a repeatable, low‑friction system that
          kept compound learning alive. Start small, track intelligently, and let consistency carry you.
